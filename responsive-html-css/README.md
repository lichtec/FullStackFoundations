Given the responsive page design (a large and small format are shown) in responsive.png, 
please create the html and css to implement this design as accurately as you can 
in responsive.html and responsive.css (feel free to use less/sass/other stylesheet languages 
although, for the evaluator's benefit, please include the processed css output). 
You may choose whatever breakpoints are sensible to you for the 2 formats. 
The font used is Georgia.
