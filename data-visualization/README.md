Data Visualization
==================

Assume that a person's propensity to engage civically is proportional to their educational
attainment and income level. Given the two (substantially cut down) datasets (in csv format),
one representing demographics and income in the KC area and one representing education, visualize in
the best possible format(s) the likelihood of the various areas represented in the datasets to
engage civically. You may use any production ready, web friendly visualization framework and
programming language to do this, html/css/js + some visualization/charting framework preferred but 
other combinations can be entertained.
